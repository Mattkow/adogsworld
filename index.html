-->

</-- This website is designed for different types of dog breeds and general information about
     how to take care of dogs.  I chose to do this because of my love for dogs, and I believe
	 that owners should not go without at least the very basics.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html> 
<title> A Dogs World </title>

</-- This is the link that enables this HTML page to use the related CSS3 style sheet.
     It also is on each individual html page.
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dog.css">
<div id="wrapper">


<body>

<header>

<img src="pawprints.png" alt="the four prints of destiny" div id="topright">


<h1> A Dogs World </h1>


</header>

</-- This is the navigation area, I chose 4 different pages (including the style page)
     because I felt like these 4 pages would be short and simple and would relay the pointe easier
-->
<nav>
<div id="navwrapper">

<ul>
<li> <a href="index.html">Home</a> </li>
<li> <a href="Information.html">Information</a> </li>
<li> <a href="breeds.html">Services</a> </li>
<li> <a href="comments.html">Contact Us</a> </li>
</ul>
</div>
</nav>

</-- Just some general information about the site, I've included a video on the front page 
     to try and catch the viewers interest!

<h3> About us: </h3>

<p> This website aims to help the public understand just what it means <br>
    to own a dog.  We do not claim to be experts by any means, however, after <br>
	years of owning this organization, there are a few tips and tricks we can impart <br>
	to you along your own journey. </p>
	
</-- I didn't have a video with a cute dog, so I used an inline format to embedd a youtube video
     of one of my favorite dog videos.

<footer> 
</-- The footer seemed like it was the easiest part of the website.
     However, at the beginning it kept moving around, so I had to mess with it a little.
