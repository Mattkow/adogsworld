<h3> General Tips and Tricks </h3>

<h4> 1. Take your Dog for a walk </h4>

<p> 	It seems common sense, I know, but getting out of the house with your <br>
    dog can increase its overall happiness - not to mention, trim your waistline!
	
<h4> 2. Play with your dog </h4>

<p> 	Much like the first on our list, playing with your pup often can <br>
    invoke feelings of happiness within your dogs subconcious! Just remember <br>
    not to play too rough!	
	
<h4> 3. Give them something to chew on </h4>

<p> 	Now for something your dog will really like! Giving your dog something <br>
    to chew on can help promote good teeth hygiene - keeping those pearly whites <br>
	clean and healthy!
	
<h4> 4. Protect your dogs from potential dangers </h4>

<p>    By keeping potential pests away from your dog - such as fleas, ticks, and other <br>
     harmful insects, you can keep them from scratching and spreading them into your home.

<h4> 5. Take your dog to the veternarian often </h4>

<p>	   It is extremely important to take your dog to the veternarian often. Make sure <br>
     you tell them about changes to your dogs diet and any other behavior changes.	 

<h4> 6. Make sure to have clean water available </h4>

<p>     This one is kind of obvious, but what a lot of people don't seem to understand is that <br>
     bacteria can form in water.  This means you should be changing your dogs water as often <br>
	 as possible.
	 
<h4> 7. Train your dog in the basics </h4>

<p>     This tip can be easier when they are younger, but it's still a pain. It's important to train <br>
     your dog in the basic commands - studies have shown that dog owners that train their dogs often <br>
	 report their dog living a long and safe life.
